                This model was created for my Junior Studio Project at Drexel University: HexaGONE. HexaGONE is a local couch brawler where players try to knock their friends off of different elemental hexagones to be the last one standing. Watch out for the different enviromental effects and enemy attacks or you'll be HexaGONE!

            <p>
                The HexaGOON was modeled based on concept art and designs created by me. The model and textures were created by me with animations from Mixamo. This was a 10 week long project to create a game project collaboratively with a small team.
