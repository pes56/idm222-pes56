                This model was created for my Senior Project at Drexel University: Bench Quest. Bench Quest is a mobile game that takes your workout tracking out of your boring notes app and into an infinte idle adventure!

            <p>
                The Abdominator was modeled based on orthographic character sheets by Adrian Bernales for our team Fit Forged. The model, textures, rig and animations were all created by me.
